All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. This course looks at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices. This course includes a number of practical exercises so that attendees can see how the different activities fit together.</p><p>The course covers a wide range of topics through a number of practical exercises, with plenty of time dedicated to group discussion:</p><ul><li>The relationship between development process and architecture<li>The roles and failure modes of testing, modelling and technology platforms<li>Different architectural styles and design patterns<li>How to transform product vision into architecture<li>Future-proofing your architecture, and accounting for uncertainty<li>How to ground your architecture and avoid overdesign<li>...and much more!</li></ul>",

In the process, you will see that once you get beyond the jargon, F# and Machine Learning are actually not all that complicated – and fit beautifully together. So if you are curious about what Machine Learning is about, and want to sharpen your developer skills, come with your laptop and… let’s hack together! What you should expect:</p><ul><li>no F# or Machine Learning prerequisites: complete beginners are totally welcome</li><li>a hands-on introduction to simple Machine Learning ideas you can use, by solving real-world problems</li><li>a practical introduction to writing effective F# code</li><li>lots of coding on fun problems!</li><li>you will need a laptop with an IDE or editor running F#; check www.fsharp.org for instructions on how to get setup.</li></ul>",

The daunting questions are how to slice (design) an application and which patterns to pick and combine in order to match your specific needs best.</p><p>This workshop will address those questions in three parts:<ul><li>In the first part you will learn about the challenges how to design applications in a resilient way, get an overview about the resilience pattern landscape, learn some of the most important patterns and when to apply them.</li><li>In the second part you will have the opportunity to apply the just learned contents to a real-life case study and design and discuss your own resilient solution.</li><li>In the last part we will complete the workshop with a peek in some complementing topics, like some advanced patterns, a resilient design cycle and how to introduce the topic into the software development process.</li></ul></p><p>After this workshop, you will have a much deeper understanding how to design a solution that satisfies your specific robustness needs.</p>",

Throughout, you will learn about the Software Craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace. Writing <b>Clean Code</b> is difficult. Cleaning existing code, even more so. You should attend if you want to:<ul><li>Write clean code that is easy to understand and maintain</li><li>Become more proficient in Test-Driven Development (TDD): using tests to design and build your code base</li><li>Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using Outside-In TDD (a.k.a. the London School of TDD)</li><li>Understand design principles that lead to clean code</li><li>Avoid over-engineering and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design using tests</li></ul></p><p>Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to <b>Legacy Code</b> to help you gain confidence in improving legacy projects through testing, refactoring and redesigning. <b>The course is fully hands-on and developers will be writing a lot of code.</b></p>",

In this session we will examine the probably biggest obstacles and pitfalls on our way towards creating resilient systems. You will learn what they are, how you identify them and what you can do about it. After all, it is still a long way to become a resilient software designer...",

Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read, and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk we re-discover Kent's original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occured and look at a better approach to TDD that supports sofware development instead of impeding it.

                      "description": "Tools like Docker and rkt make it easier than ever to package and distribute applications. Unfortunately, not all organizations have the luxury of being able to package their applications in a container runtime. Many organizations have virtualized workloads that cannot be easily containerized, such as applications that require full hardware isolation or virtual appliances. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some organizations deploy workloads that are already static binaries such as Go applications or Java applications that only rely on the JVM. These types of applications do not benefit from containerization as they are already self-contained. To address the growing heterogeneity of workloads, HashiCorp created Nomad – a globally aware, distributed scheduler and cluster manager. Nomad is designed to handle many types of workloads, on a variety of operating systems, at massive scale. Nomad empowers developers to specify jobs and tasks using a high-level specification in a plain-text file. Nomad accepts the job specification, parses the information, determines which compatible hosts have available resources, and then automatically manages the placement, healing, and scaling of the application. By placing multiple applications per host, Nomad maximizes resource utilization and dramatically reduces infrastructure costs. The flexibility of Nomad’s design brings the benefits of a scheduled application workflow to organizations with heterogeneous workloads and operating systems. This talk will discuss the pros and cons of running in a scheduled environment and includes a series of live demos to supplement the learning experience.",

Is that the scope you most often see? Probably not. Somehow Java devs became crazy communists-capitalists, recognising only private and public access, and preferring public everywhere. And so our projects look like a lawn right after snow melts: full of shit laying in public. Hard to put into your head. Hard to reason about. Entanglement instead of encapsulation. People even register every possible class in an IoC container, because FU (nctional) programming, that's why. You wanna find something in my code? Google it. Or how about inheritance? James Gosling asked in 2001 about what he would do differently if he had a chance to recreate Java, said he would probably remove class inheritance. We are in 2016, having lambdas, defaults on interfaces, AOP and other tricks, but young developers still prefer to just add another abstract class to your code. Gonna be fun navigating those seven layers of hell when you read it. Ok, maybe it's not THAT bad, but it's not much better either. The problem of course, is that we all start with tutorials, which cut corners for brevity. And we don't pay attention to those small problems till they hit us hard. Let's see how we can make our situation a little bit better, using Domain Driven Design, package-private scope, sensible packaging structure, and CQRS on microservices.
